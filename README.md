# Udacity_SDC_NN_Clone_Driving
Use Deep Learning to Clone Driving Behavior  - Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Project
Implementation by Jordi Tudela Alc√†cer

Built and trained a convolutional neural network for end-to-end driving in a simulator, using TensorFlow and Keras. Used optimization techniques such as regularization and dropout to generalize the network for driving on multiple tracks.
